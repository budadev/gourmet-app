    "Added scan overlap guard + status hints; safety hint after 15s without result",
    "Refined scanner cleanup and race prevention with opening flag",
    "Improved iOS single-tap reliability (combined with prior 0.0.39 optimizations)",

    "Immediate 'Initializing cameraâ€¦' and 'Point camera at barcode' status messages for user feedback",
    "Added safety hint after 15s if no barcode found",
    "Guard against overlapping scan opens (prevents multiple taps creating race)",

    "Retains prior 0.0.38 improvements (single-event scan, disabled state, accessibility aria-disabled)",
    "Improved reliability of all barcode scan buttons on iOS by removing dual click/touchend handlers and the delayed debounce that could break Safari's user-gesture requirement (now immediate, single 'click' handler)",
    "Added temporary 'scanning' disabled state (visual dim + pointer lock) to prevent accidental double taps",
    "Reduced barcode button active scale effect (0.96) to avoid visual jump / mis-tap sensation on iOS",
    "Accessibility: buttons now set aria-disabled during active scan",
    "Improved camera permission handling with better user messaging",
    "Added helpful first-time info about iOS camera permission requirement",
    "Enhanced error messages for camera access issues",
    "Note: iOS requires camera permission each app restart (Safari limitation)",
    "iOS: Fixed filter menu header overlapping with camera island/notch",
    "iOS: Reduced bottom gap for Clear Filters button on mobile",
    "Filter panel width now matches left menu (280px, max 85vw)",
